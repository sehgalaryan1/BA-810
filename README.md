This project focuses on predicting the popularity of newly published news articles by analyzing key features that influence user engagement. Using factors such as title length, article category, publication date, and trends, we develop a machine learning model to estimate article success, defined as the ratio of clicks to impressions. The goal is to empower news platforms with data-driven insights to optimize content selection, promotion strategies, and personalized recommendations, ultimately enhancing reader engagement and improving platform performance.
